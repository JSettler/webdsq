Gemini-2.5-pro was unable to create a decent AI-engine for the game, yet.

We might need to have to wait for that enigmatic new "Nightwhisper" AI (NW), to get well-written working code for a decent boardgame engine :(

Chances are, that NW could re-appear in LMsys arena, luckily you can re-generate responses in battlemode, even after voting.
This enables users to recognize models before voting :)

(The battlemode of lmarena has much more generous limits than direct-chat.)
